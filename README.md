## To Start the Application

There are two ways of using my application. It could be used either via docker or through my github repo, https://github.com/kg3354/Coinbase_web



- `Using Github`

To use my github repo, please execute the following instructions

```
git clone https://github.com/kg3354/jsDbFrontend
cd jsDbFrontend
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
```

Now have one terminal inside jsDbFrontend directory, run
```
node server.js
```


Have another terminal inside frontend directory, run
```
npm start
```


You can then view the application from http://localhost:3001, or using the ip address provided by the terminal!

## Key Implementations

I made sure all of the requirements are being designed, including

- API Integration
- Front End
- Testing  
- Environment

Additional features that I added includes:

- ChatGPT Chat Box
- Back End
- Set Time To Now Button
- Add/Remove Channel/Guild Pair Functionality
- Time Lock on Start/End Time
- Multiple Access on the same network
- Automatic Channel/Guild fetch

The github repo is https://github.com/kg3354/jsDbFrontend
