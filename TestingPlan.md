# Testing Plan

The testing plan for the coinbase web project is seperated to 4 sections, which corresponds to the 4 main scripts of the project: server.js, my_asset.js, all_product.js, and App.js

## Testing Plan for server.js 

The server should be tested to ensure it:

- Handles requests correctly across different endpoints.
- Validates and processes parameters correctly.
- Executes external scripts and handles their output appropriately.
- Integrates effectively with external APIs.
- Manages errors and unexpected situations robustly.


Testing Tools: 

- Jest: For running unit and integration tests.
- Supertest: To make HTTP requests to the server within tests.
- Mocking Libraries (e.g., jest.mock): To mock dependencies like axios and exec.
- dotenv: For managing environment variables during tests.


### Detailed Testing Steps

#### 1. Unit Testing

**Functions**

- **isValidDate**:
  - Test with valid and invalid ISO strings.
  - Check for proper boolean returns.
  - Tested manually, the locks on date works just as expected 


**Middleware**

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Simulate multiple requests to test if the rate limiting kicks in as expected.
  - Ensure that after the limit is reached, the server responds with the correct HTTP status code.

- **CORS**:
  - Test with requests from allowed and not allowed origins to ensure CORS headers are set correctly.

#### 2. Integration Testing

**API Endpoints**

- **GET /api/prices**:
  - Mock axios to simulate API responses from the external service.
  - Test with both valid and invalid query parameters.
  - Check the response format and status codes.
  - Tested manually, the get call functions as expected when the server is on.

- **GET /api/sandbox-assets**:
  - Mock exec to simulate both successful and error scenarios.
  - Verify the parsing and handling of stdout.
  - Test error handling when stderr or execution errors occur.
  - Tested manually, the get call functions as expected when the server is on.


**External Script Execution**

- **runAllProductScript and related operations:**:
  - Mock exec to simulate the running of the script.
  - Test handling of stdout, stderr, and errors.


#### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **Use Supertest to simulate full request/response cycles.**

- **Combine tests for rate limiting, CORS, and API responses to simulate realistic server usage.**


#### 4. Error Handling

- **Test for unexpected exceptions and errors in routes and middleware.**

- **Ensure that all endpoints handle failures (like API downtime or invalid responses) gracefully.**


#### 5. Security Testing

- **Check that all sensitive endpoints are protected against common vulnerabilities like XSS, and CSRF.**

- **Verify that sensitive data is not logged or exposed in error messages or responses.**

- **With this being said, the Sandbox My Asset confirguration has to be moved to config file**


#### 6. Performance Testing

- **Assess the server's performance under load, particularly for the more data-intensive endpoints like /api/prices.**

### Continuous Integration Setup

- Integrate these tests into a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.

- Configure tests to run on pushes and pull requests to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Additional Considerations

- Environment Configuration: Ensure tests run in a controlled environment where variables like API keys and other configurations are securely managed.

- Test Coverage: Aim for high test coverage to catch as many issues as possible before deployment.


## Testing Plan for my_asset.js 


### Overview
The script should be tested to ensure it:
1. Correctly generates HMAC signatures and sets HTTP headers.
2. Properly handles API responses, including successful data fetches and various error scenarios.
3. Accurately processes and formats the fetched data.
4. Manages errors robustly and logs them appropriately.

### Testing Tools
- **Jest**: For running tests and asserting outcomes.
- **nock**: To mock HTTP requests and responses from the Coinbase API.
- **sinon** or **jest.spyOn()**: To spy on and assert calls to console methods and process methods.

### Detailed Testing Steps

#### 1. Unit Testing

##### Authentication and Request Setup

- **HMAC Signature Generation**:

  - Test that the HMAC signature is correctly generated using the provided API secret, timestamp, method, and request path.

  - Assert that the `axios` request is configured with the correct headers including the generated HMAC signature.

##### API Request Configuration

- Mock `axios.request` using nock to simulate API responses.

- Test the script with both successful and erroneous API responses to verify correct handling and logging.

#### 2. Integration Testing

##### Data Processing and Output

- **Successful API Response**:
  - Simulate a successful response from the API with a predefined set of account data.

  - Verify that the script processes this data correctly into the desired format.

  - Ensure that the processed data is outputted correctly using `process.stdout.write`.

- **Error Handling**:

  - Simulate various API errors (e.g., network issues, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Errors).

  - Test how the script handles these errors, focusing on error logging and process exiting with an error code.

#### 3. Functional Testing

- Combine tests for HMAC generation, API communication, data processing, and error handling to ensure that the entire script functions as expected from start to finish.

#### 4. Security Testing

- **Sensitive Data Handling**:

  - Ensure that API keys and secrets are not exposed in any logs or error messages.

  - Test the secure storage and usage of credentials.

#### 5. Performance Testing

- Assess how the script handles large volumes of data from the API to ensure it processes data efficiently without performance degradation.

### Continuous Integration Setup

- Integrate these tests into your CI/CD pipeline to run automatically on code commits and before deployments.

- Use environment variables for API keys and secrets in the CI environment to ensure security.

### Additional Considerations

- **Robustness**: Since the script relies on external APIs, include tests for handling unexpected changes in the API's response format.

- **Documentation**: Ensure that changes in API handling are documented, and test cases are updated accordingly to maintain relevance.
